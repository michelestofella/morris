# MorrisLecar

This folder contains the automated scripts used to integrate the Morris Lecar model, to perform bifurcation analysis and to draw the frequency plot. For a description of the model, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrisâ€“Lecar_model). For an accurate derivation of the model, see Ingalls (2013), *Mathematical Modeling in Systems Biology. An Introduction*, MIT Press. 

## fixed_parameters.py

In this file the needed libraries are imported, together with the 4th order Runge Kutta method (implemented in `morris\rungekutta\rk4_system.py`) and the bidimensional Newton algorithm (implemented in `morris\newton\newton2.py`). 

Furthermore, the model parameters are here set following, as in the main paper, Liu (2014), *Bifurcation Analysis of a Morris-Lecar neuruon model*, Biol Cybern 108;75-84. 

The parameters over which bifurcation analysis is to be implemented, namely `v_ca` and `I_app` are not defined in this file.

## integrate.py

This file contains the integration of the Morris Lecar model through the Runge Kutta algorithm (imported by `morris\rungekutta\rk4_system.py`) and a visualization of the signal voltage in time and of the phase space is shown. 
We give here a description of the script, following the block of code.

First of all, several parameters must be parsed to the script:
* --v_ca  the parameter of the morris lecar model that discriminates different classes of neurons.
* --I_app the external current applied to the model 
* --dt    integration time step
* --Nstep number of integration steps to be performed
* --v0    initial condition on the voltage
* --w0    initial condition of the fraction of opened channels
* --out   name of the generated figure

Second, we introduce the fixed parameters of the model as described by Liu (2014), importing them from `fixed_parameters.py`. 

Then, the Runge Kutta algorithm is applied following the parameters given as input.

Finally, a plot shows the evolution of the voltage through time and the trajectories in the phase space. The plot is saved as png file with the name given as input. An example is given by the following image.

## bifurcation_analysis.py

The file **morris2.py** contains the bifurcation analysis of the model. In order to perform bifurcation analysis, we follow the following scheme:
* We set the value of `I_app`
* We apply the two dimensional Newton algorithm to find the zeros of the Morris Lecar model
* For each zero found, we calculate the eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix to establish if the zero the point is stable or unstable.
* We change the value of `I_app`, covering the range 0-100

First of all, several parameters must be parsed to the algorithm:
*   --v_ca  the parameter of the morris lecar model that discriminates different classes of neurons.
*  --Imin  minimum value of applied current analysed
*   --Imax  maximum value of applied current analysed 
*   --v0min minimum value of initial condition on voltage
*   --v0max maximum value of initial condition on voltage
*   --out   name of the generated figure

Second, the model parameters are imported from `fixed_parameters.py`, together with the bidimensional Newton algorithm (imported from `morris\newton\newton2.py`) and the Runge Kutta algorithm (imported from `morris\rungekutta\rk4_system.py`).

Then, we set the range of values of `I_app` and the set of initial conditions `v0` to perform bifurcation analysis. For example,
```
I_app_values = np.linspace(0,100,201)    
v0_values = np.linspace(-80,40,61)
```
Now we can start bifurcation analysis: for each value of `I_app`, we find all the zeros of the model by exploiting several initial guess values and applying the bidimensional Newton algorithm. 
All the zeros found are appended to two lists `v_zeros` and `w_zeros`.

In the next block, stability is discriminated. We calculate the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix for each zero found previously. If all the eigenvalues are negative, than the point is stable, otherwise it is unstable. 
Two lists, namely `stable` and `unstable` are generated and contain respectively the stable and unstable points. Each element of the list is itself a list containing `I_app, v_zeros, w_zeros, stability`, where the last element is a string containing *stable* or *unstable*.

Before plotting the data, we reorganize them into pandas dataframes so that they are more ordered.

Finally, we plot the bifurcation diagram: for each value of `I_app`, we plot the stable (solid line) and the unstable (dashed line) points. 
The figure is saved as png file with a name given by the input parameter `--out`.
An example is here shown.

## frequency_plot.py

This file contains the script to reproduce the frequency plot. 

To calculate the frequency of the generated output signal, we use the Scipy function `find_peaks`.

First of all, several parameters must be parsed:
* --v_ca  the parameter of the morris lecar model that discriminates different classes of neurons.
* --dt    integration time step
* --Nstep number of integration steps to be performed
* --v0    initial condition on the voltage
* --w0    initial condition of the fraction of opened channels
* --Imin  minimum value of applied current analysed
* --Imax  maximum value of applied current analysed 
* --out   name of the generated figure

Second, we need to import the parameters and the Runge Kutta algorithm from `fixed_parameters.py` and we have to define the Morris Lecar model for the Runge Kutta integration.

We then have to set the values of `I_app` through which we want to calculate the signal. The parameters for the integration are defined by the parsed parameters and the Runge Kutta algorithm is applied.
At the end of each application of the algorithm, the generated signal is analyzed. If the action potential has been generated, then the generated signal is periodic. Using the function `find_peaks`, we detect the maxima of the signal, we take the mean value of the periods of the signal and we take as frequency the inverse of such a period. 

**Attention**: the action potential is generated above the threshold. For class1 neurons (see the paper for further details), the output frequency should be very small. Above the threshold, the higher the `I_app`, the higher the frequency. To reach smaller frequencies, the system should be integrated for an appropriate time interval, otherwise the second peak is not reached. 

Finally, the frequency plot is shown: for each `I_app` value, the calculated frequency is plotted. The figure is saved as a png file with the name given with the input parameter `--out`. An example is shown in the following image.
